# when 

14 / 15 November 2014

# Venue

Paris, France

Now that the date is set, I will need to confirm it with squat peoples, definitive venue will be announced internally around the 20 ish Sept.

# capacity

I see around 50/70 attendee so we can pull out chairs or at least decent way to support the whole day

# Food

Squat usually make stand to sell food during events like theses, so they got money in, that would allow us not to spend cash on food and them make some (we may need to supply soft drink tho ^^). 

I will also contact ppl from the rave party scene to see if they would be interested to make a rave as an after party, in such case they will also live on the sales in the bars and can help gather catering 

# Format

one single track since we don't have that much screens / sound system, if we have too much good speaker we will make it 2 day long
