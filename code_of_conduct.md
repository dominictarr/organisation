#SquatConf code of conduct
All attendees, staff, speakers, volunteers and other invited guests are required to _agree to_ and _comply with_ the following code of conduct, without exception.

## tl;dr

> thou shall not act like an asshole. 

## Got a minute ?
A squat is a living place, where people sleep & eat, it is their home and they generously offer us a place to do our crazy experiments, socialize & share our knowledge. In return, we _must_ respect the inhabitants and the boundaries that will be in place (while there are open & communal places, the living quarters are private and therefore usually off limits to guests).

_Let this be your guide_
> give the amount of respect that you would expect should be given if it were your home.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
**We will not accept ANY form of harassment**
(if you are not sure what I am talking about please read the extended version)
This is non-negotiable, if you are suspected of improper behavior we will politely inform you that you must leave.

## Extended version

**definition of a harassement**

This list is not a *laisser passer* to do anything that is not listed here, most of it will be obvious to the people we expect to join us for SquatConf.  

- verbal comments 
	- race
	- gender
	- appearance
	- sexual orientation
	- religion
	- disability
- intimidation (physical or otherwise)
- harassing photography or recording (do NOT joke about this one in a squat)
- stalking, following, insistant flirting, etc, etc
- disrupting of talks and/or workshops
- joking about people with [silly hats](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbw3wd1K9Y1qbj9bf.gif)

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

The first paragraph is only common sense we count on you to enforce it, for the harassment part, please report directly to the staff in attendance with any issue.  
Please be aware that if the harassments target the squat inhabitants.. <what here ???>

**other manners & reminders**

Respect opinions of other people you interact with, share knowledge with them, enjoy the good times and bring this spirit as you would in your own home is what we expect from you. This is what you can expect from us as well.

## Final note

This document is mandatory when you create a public event, but what I really dream is that one day, we won't need this. We know our friends in the various communities that we engage with, by choice, and they are reasonable people. I'm 100% sure that this conference will attract the kind of people that do not need to read such a document to act accordingly.

SquatConf staff.
