#SquatConf code of conduct
following code of conduct is to be agreed by all person attending, staff, speakers, and attendee.

## tl;dr

> thou shall not act like an asshole. 

## Got a minute ?
A squat is a living place, people sleeps, create, eat there and they offer us a place to do our crazy stuffs, we need in return to respect it inhabitants and the boundaries they will place (while an open place, living quarter are usually off limits), apart from that give the amount of respect you expect you should be given is not a bad rule of thumb.

quick note : we won't accept any form of harassment (if you are not sure about what I'm talking about please read the extended version), PERIOD.

## extended version

**definition of a harassement**

This list is not a *laisser passer* to do anything not listed here and for most if it will sound obvious to the people we expect to draw to SquatConf.  

- verbal comments 
	- race
	- gender
	- apparence
	- sexual orientation
	- religion
	- disability
- intimidation (physical or not)
- harassing photography or recording (do NOT joke about this one in a squat)
- stalking, following, insistant flirting, etc, etc
- disrupting talks/workshop
- joking about people with [silly hats](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbw3wd1K9Y1qbj9bf.gif)

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviors are expected to comply immediately.

The first paragraph is only common sense we count on you to enforce it, for the harassment part, report us any issue.  
Please keep in mind that our security may be a bit rougher, particularly if the harassments target the squat inhabitants.

**other manners reminders**

Respect opinions of the people you talk to, share knowledges with them, enjoy good times and bring this spirit to your home is what we expect from you. I hope this is what you expect from us as well. 

## last note

This document is mandatory when you create a public event, but what I really dream that we won't need it one day, and I'm sure this conference will draw the kind of people that does not need to read such a document to act accordingly.
